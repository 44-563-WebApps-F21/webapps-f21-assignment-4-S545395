<h2>Vera, or the Nihilists</h2>
<h3>ACT III._Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace, hung with yellow
    tapestry. Table, with chair of State, set for the Czar; window behind,
    opening on to a balcony. As the scene progresses the light outside gets
    darker._</h3>

    <h5 class="prince-petro">PRINCE PETRO.</h5> <p class="speech">So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
at last, and is to take his seat here again.</p>

<h5 class="prince-paul"> PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p class="speech">Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.</p>

<h5 class="prince-petro">PRINCE PETRO.</h5><p class="speech"> Naturally; you are always speaking.</p>

<h5 class="prince-paul">PRINCE PAUL.</h5><p class="speech"> No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.</p>

<h5 class="count">COUNT R.</h5> <p class="speech">Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.</p>

<h5 class="prince-paul">PRINCE PAUL.</h5> <p class="speech">My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place. <p class="stage-direction">(_Enter the
CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._)</p> Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
Highness is looking a little pale to-day.</p>

<h5 class="czare">CZARE.</h5> <p class="stage-direction">(_slowly, after a pause_).</p> <p class="speech">I want change of air.</p>

<h5 class="prince-paul">PRINCE PAUL</h5> <p class="stage-direction">(_smiling_).</p> <p class="speech">A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
Russia.</p>

<h5 class="czare">CZARE.</h5> <p class="stage-direction">(_bitterly_).</p> <p class="speech">My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.</p>
