<h3>ACT II._Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace, hung with yellow
    tapestry. Table, with chair of State, set for the Czar; window behind,
    opening on to a balcony. As the scene progresses the light outside gets
    darker._</h3>

    PRINCE PETRO. So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
at last, and is to take his seat here again.<br><br>

PRINCE PAUL. Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.<br><br>

PRINCE PETRO. Naturally; you are always speaking.<br><br>

PRINCE PAUL. No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.<br><br>

COUNT R. Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.<br><br>

PRINCE PAUL. My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place. (_Enter the
CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._) Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
Highness is looking a little pale to-day.<br><br>

CZARE. (_slowly, after a pause_). I want change of air.<br><br>

PRINCE PAUL (_smiling_). A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
Russia.<br><br>

CZARE. (_bitterly_). My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.<br><br>
